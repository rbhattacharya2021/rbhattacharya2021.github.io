    <p> 
        On this page, I am going to talk about both how minorities AND the police force can change their perspectives to 
        hopefully strengthen the relationship between the two.
    </p>

    <p><span class="w3-tag"> MINORITY PERSPECTIVE: </span> </p>
        
    <p> 
        To say that most minorities have no faith in the police force treating them fairly is an understatement.
    </p>

    <p> 
        In 2015, a study by Gallop found out that less than 50% of the nation's population has faith in the police force.
        1 out of every 2 Hispanics and 2 out of every 3 African Americans distrust the police, not having ANY confidence 
        in the police officer treating them fairly.
    </p>

    <p> 
        In major cities, there is a clear disconnect between the amount of each race's police stops compared to the actual
        percentage of their racial group in their city's population. This includes cities like Los Angeles and Philadelphia 
        where minority groups make up more than half the amount of police stops despite not being high in numbers. For example,
         72% of police stops in Philadelphia were against African Americans, despite making up roughly 44% of the city 
         population meaning that they make up over two-thirds of total police stops in the city.
    </p>

    <p> 
        This exemplifies why minorities have this distrust towards police officers since almost every statistic documents 
        the fact that minorities are disrespected, mistreated, harassed, and ultimately disproportionately stopped and/or 
        arrested. An interesting source that can show you if your city follows a similar pattern can be found here.
    </p>

    <p><span class="w3-tag"> POLICE PERSPECTIVE: </span> </p>

    <p> 
        With that being said, many police officers still understand the change that needs to be made, and they are actively 
        trying to promote growth and change at a time of need.
    </p>

    <p> 
        Many police officers do not side with those who use their power and position to act above the law or treat others as 
        inferior. When asked about many instances of police brutality, a former police officer for 29 years Tyrone Dodson 
        talked about his approach on both how he was an officer and the current state of police officers.
    </p>

    <p> 
        He talks about the incident in Baton Rouge where Alton Sterling lost his life, where former officer Dodson talks about
        how tackling and slamming Sterling into a car is "a big no-no" and that he has NEVER seen anyone do something like
        that before. He also goes on to talk about how both black and non-black police officers have added pressure due to 
        the unfortunate events that have been happening recently, and that many police officers are actively trying to repair 
        the relationship between them and their community stating,
    </p>
    
    <p> 
        "They want to do the right thing to try to help these young people understand that you need to cooperate and that
        police officers are not your enemies. They’re your friends. They’re supposed to be peacemakers, not hurt you."
    </p>

    <p> 
        Statistics also show that many police officers, especially African American police officers, also understand that 
        there need to be fundamental changes to help aid this disconnect, as a poll in 2016 showed that 57% of officers believe 
        there are issues within policing with many of them also calling for some sort of reform.
    </p>

    <p><span class="w3-tag"> POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS: </span> </p>
    
    <p> 
        Hopefully, with how people are demanding change more and more, there will be some potential solutions to this issue that 
        can limit or eventually stop leading to a more unified, loved, and most importantly safe nation.
    </p>

    <p> 
        Solutions to this issue can be sometimes difficult to come up with. People like to throw out solutions such as limit cops 
        with implicit bias or stop them from racially profiling citizens and while that can help limit some cases, it is a very 
        difficult thing to measure and limit. Thankfully, I have thought about some potential solutions that might help.
    </p>

    <p> 
        Some more complicated solutions directly by the police force can be things such as a stronger vetting system to remove any 
        potentially aggressive officers. Other aspects such as taking a portion of the budget and using it to directly give back to 
        the community can not only strengthen the relationship between police officers and those they protect but also allow for that 
        money to be used by people in need. The biggest and most impactful solution can also be to do more in collaboration exercises 
        and training of people with different backgrounds.
    </p>

    <p> 
        Research done by psychologists both at Stanford and Yale has found out that when people of different backgrounds need to 
        cooperate, it leads to them learning more about each other. In addition, it is reported that potential racial bias declines 
        drastically during the training/collaboration and for an extended period after that. This means that regardless of race, gender,
        sexual orientation, or socioeconomic status, officers are more knowledgeable about the different types of people that they might encounter along with the different challenges they might have had to endure.
    </p>

    <p> 
        Of course, even little things can go a long way, especially on a topic and a problem like this. As I have said so a bunch already, 
        just putting forth the effort to try and potentially make a change in the world is the first and most important step to make. By doing 
        anything in your power to potentially try to help push us in the right direction is already progress as it is. The hope is that one day 
        the voices of minorities will not be silenced and systemic change will finally happen to allow for a better relationship and a better 
        world for the future.
