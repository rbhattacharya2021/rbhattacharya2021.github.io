      <p> 
          The main reasons why I chose this topic to focus on are due to several factors. To start, I am a person of 
          color and have had my encounters and experiences of racial discrimination by police officers.
     </p>


     <p> 
          I have been outspoken about this issue for quite a while and have attended many protests, rallies, and group 
          discussions within my community and I felt like it was time to branch out and see if I can reach even more 
          people.
     </p>

     <p> 
          Whether it is having conversations with your peers, providing interesting and insightful articles or videos 
          to members of your community, or just actively trying to push and strive for a better, more united nation and 
          world.
     </p>

     <p> 
          Even at the young age of 15, I have dealt with many racist people in and around the area I live, including many 
          police officers who have treated me and many of my other minority friends harshly and cruelly.
     </p>

      <p>
          I can recall a time where I was with another one of my friends and we were driving around a local mall that we 
          regularly go to. Upon leaving the parking structure, we turn onto the street right before the main road to go 
          home.
     </p>
        
      <p> 
          As soon as we turned right, we heard sirens blare immediately. At first, we were confused as we had no idea what 
          we did. Once he approached us, both of us had an uneasy feeling... almost as if our lives could be in danger.
     </p>   

      <p> 
          We found out we made a rolling stop and turn when we exited the parking lot, yet someone approaching the situation 
          would not be able to figure that out.
     </p>

      <p> 
          Racial remarks such as "how much weed is in the car" the minute he approached us and "you two seem like the type to 
          always get into trouble" along with never removing his hand from his holster, all added onto the already piled up 
          feelings of fear in both of us.
     </p>
    
      <p> 
          While thankfully we were charged with nothing more than a ticket, the car ride home was silent with both of us trying
          to process what just happened. Two 15-year-old kids could have almost lost their lives on a routine weekend visit to 
          our local mall.
     </p>
